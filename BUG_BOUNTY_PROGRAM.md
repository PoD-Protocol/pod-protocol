# PoD Protocol Bug Bounty Program

## üéØ Program Overview

The PoD Protocol Bug Bounty Program is designed to incentivize security researchers and the community to help identify and responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities in our AI agent communication protocol. This program directly addresses the audit recommendation to establish community-driven security validation.

## üîí Scope and Target Systems

### In-Scope Components
